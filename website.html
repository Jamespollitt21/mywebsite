        <h2>   Risks That Might Impact of Digital Projects  </h2>
        <div>
            <p> Some of the reasons why the digital projects fail is because the idea has already been done and there might be so many </p>
            <p> versions of it being done. the customers there might be a lack of leadership and accountability, every leader has to   </p>
            <p> know what every co worker is doing and know how far they are into there tasks to accomplish the projects. if they are </p>
            <p> not completing the tasks there will be a back log of work for the company and will be up loosing there customers and  </p>
            <p> clients. If the leader orgainising the projects and sets the team roles to complete the work it will work best. </p>
            <p> non existant plans and timelines this will make a confusing work enviroment for everyone in the work place, This will </p>
            <p> make people do things that are already done and will make the project fall behind on deadlines. Setting time lines for </p>
            <p> the tasks and project. If the is a lack of communication this will make people not know where you are up to and you  </p>
            <p> might have to work with the team that are working on different sectors or roles. You can also over communicate to </p>
            <p> people in a work place there is also a way of sorting problems out by going to the leader and to the ask people in your </p>
            <p> team. the last one can be failure to address user feedback. Not getting someone to test it out then project will not be </p>
            <p> a great outcome for the company or team the customers will complain about the project that wont work. All of these    </p>
            <p> together can give your company a bad reputation and people will not use you as a business partner or go to use your </p>
            <p> products or services </p>

        <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </h2>

        <div>

            <p> There are laws for digital projects such as copy right and GDPR (General Data Protection regulation) these are </p>
            <p> to protect the clients/customers and for peeple who have made projects for companies. During my time at college </p>
            <p> with copy rights you can provide the information only if you provide where the source of information came from </p>
            <p> and not claiming the information as your own. What GDPR is the information provided by customers or staff     </p>
            <p> the company will have to protect the information and will not hand over the information for their own gain. </p>
            <P> there will be regulations that the company or customers and staff will have tom follow to protect the data     </P>
            <p> or the information of the company and for the customer. if they break some of the rules or regulations laws </p>
            <p> they will have to prove the court wrong that they didnt break any of these laws.                              </p>

        </div>

        <h3> The Constraint what they are and their impacts</h3>

        <div>

            
            <li> The Constraint are the planning task required the costs and budget of it all 
                 and time schedual of the project.</li>
            
            <ul>

            <li> Cost: The financial amount of the tasks for the project, also known as the project budget to expect the
                 of the project so you can save or pay for the resourses.</li>

            <li> Scope: The tasks required that you need to complete for the project so you know what to do and the
                team you are working with know aswell. </li>

            <li> Time: The schedule for tasks and the over all project to be completed. This will plan how long each
                task will take when you will finish the task.</li>
    
            <li> Risks: What can go wrong and how to face them. When there is a problem you will know how to deal with
                 it if or when they come along. </li>

            <li> resourse: these are the the things you will use for your project e.g. internet, software, people
                 and matrials. This is so you can use these resourses to hit goals for your project.</li>

            <li> qualities: How close to the reality of the outcome is matching the outcome. This is to make sure you
                 will meet the deadline of the project and tasks.</li>
                </ul>


            <P> With this planning you will get a rough estimate of the over project and how much you will have to achieve </P>
            <p> the project.</p>
