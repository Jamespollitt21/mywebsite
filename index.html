        <h2>   Risks That Might Impact of Digital Projects  </h2>
        <div>
            <p> Some of the reasons why the digital projects fail is because the idea has already been done and there might be so many </p>
            <p> versions of it being done. the customers there might be a lack of leadership and accountability, every leader has to   </p>
            <p> know what every co worker is doing and know how far they are into there tasks to accomplish the projects. if they are </p>
            <p> not completing the tasks there will be a back log of work for the company and will be up loosing there customers and  </p>
            <p> clients. If the leader orgainising the projects and sets the team roles to complete the work it will work best. </p>
            <p> non existant plans and timelines this will make a confusing work enviroment for everyone in the work place, This will </p>
            <p> make people do things that are already done and will make the project fall behind on deadlines. Setting time lines for </p>
            <p> the tasks and project. If the is a lack of communication this will make people not know where you are up to and you  </p>
            <p> might have to work with the team that are working on different sectors or roles. You can also over communicate to </p>
            <p> people in a work place there is also a way of sorting problems out by going to the leader and to the ask people in your </p>
            <p> team. the last one can be failure to address user feedback. Not getting someone to test it out then project will not be </p>
            <p> a great outcome for the company or team the customers will complain about the project that wont work. All of these    </p>
            <p> together can give your company a bad reputation and people will not use you as a business partner or go to use your </p>
            <p> products or services </p>

        <h2>  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software  </h2>
        <div>

            <p> If i had a job for web, blogger or app developer i would like to use visual studio for the website and xcode i would use it on a </p>

            <p> and the dvd. I made leaflets when i was in college and the one who wins would be selected to be used for the </p>
            <p> college to be handed out. I made a video in my group to add music and text for the video and created it </p>
            <p> our self by using movie maker. in the time of myu course i have used xcode for making an app and making it </p>

            <p> and keynote some of the things i have learnt how to use a Macbook Pro. The main things i do like is making the websites </p>

            <p> trello has helped me alot by orgainaing me and how to priorities taskes. I can link it to my phone so i will get reminders </p>
            <p> you about the tasks and will remind the people on the tasks what to do and when they should do that along with <P>

        <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </h2>

        <div>

            <p> There are laws for digital projects such as copy right and GDPR (General Data Protection regulation) these are </p>
            <p> to protect the clients/customers and for peeple who have made projects for companies. During my time at college </p>
            <p> with copy rights you can provide the information only if you provide where the source of information came from </p>
            <p> and not claiming the information as your own. What GDPR is the information provided by customers or staff     </p>
            <p> the company will have to protect the information and will not hand over the information for their own gain. </p>
            <P> there will be regulations that the company or customers and staff will have tom follow to protect the data     </P>
            <p> or the information of the company and for the customer. if they break some of the rules or regulations laws </p>
            <p> they will have to prove the court wrong that they didnt break any of these laws.                              </p>

        </div>

        <h3> The Constraint what they are and their impacts</h3>

        <div>

            
            <li> The Constraint are the planning task required the costs and budget of it all 
                 and time schedual of the project.</li>
            
            <ul2    >

            <li> Cost: The financial amount of the tasks for the project, also known as the project budget to expect the
                 of the project so you can save or pay for the resourses.</li>

            <li> Scope: The tasks required that you need to complete for the project so you know what to do and the
                team you are working with know aswell. </li>

            <li> Time: The schedule for tasks and the over all project to be completed. This will plan how long each
                task will take when you will finish the task.</li>
    
            <li> Risks: What can go wrong and how to face them. When there is a problem you will know how to deal with
                 it if or when they come along. </li>

            <li> resourse: these are the the things you will use for your project e.g. internet, software, people
                 and matrials. This is so you can use these resourses to hit goals for your project.</li>

            <li> qualities: How close to the reality of the outcome is matching the outcome. This is to make sure you
                 will meet the deadline of the project and tasks.</li>
            </ul>


            <P> With this planning you will get a rough estimate of the over project and how much you will have to achieve
                the project.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Review Of Tools And What I Would Change</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>The tools that i used when making this website was Visual Studio Code, Trello, Github, Slack and used
               HTML and CSS used on a Macbook Pro</p> 
               
               <p>I found it difficult when using the CSS to style the web page and putting images on the website
                   how to add a picture on your background and to orgainise the text and layout of the website.
                   I would prefer to use a windows than a Macbook but would have to get used to using apple
                   product like a laptop or computer. The changes i would ldo if i was making a website is by managing
                   my trello first then add the content to the website.
               </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Was The IT Tools Appropriate </h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The tools that i used such as Trello, Macbook, Visual Studio Code and Slack are appropriate because
                they got my website running. The Macbook Pro i am not used to using it as i am used to using the
                window software. I would have to get used to the MacBook Pro as mopst companies are using Apple
                products graphics and web developing companies.

            <h1>My Strengths And Weaknesses During The Website</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>While making this website i have found out my strengths are:


                <ul>
                   <li>HTML</li>
                   <li>Research</li>
                   <li>organising</li>
                   <li>Creative</li>
                   <li>Typing</li>
                   <li>Trying New Things</li>
                   <li>Trello</li>
                    
                </ul>
            
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>

            <p>While making this website i have found out my weeknesses are:

            </p>

                 <ul>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>Meeting Deadling</li>
                    <li>Structure/Layout</li>
                    <li>designing</li>
                    <li>Knowledge Of Coding CSS And HTML Together </li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>I am not happy with the layout of the website as it is not structured and looks the way i want
               it to look. the reason for this is that i need to know a bit more about the codes for CSS and HTML
               to make the website look appealing and more professional layout to the website. The background of
               website looks really good with the pictures but i would have to seperate the sub-heading and 
               pictures to make it look more structured and the layout look professional.
            </p>

        </div>


        <div>
            <h1>The Improvments I Would Make To The Website</h1>

            <ol>
                <li>Add Margin To Sections</li>
                <li>Seperate Sections</li>
                <li>Add More Pictures</li>
                <li>Add Buttons</li>
                <li>Add Pages</li>
                <li>Look At More Codes</li>
                <li>Add Videos If I Could To Make It Look More Easier</li>

            </ol>
            <P> If i added all these thing to my website it will improve my website by layout looks and much
                more interesting.
            </P>

        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h1>The Outcome Of The Website Requirements And Fit For Purpose</h1>
            
            <p>The outcome of the website is good but basic it does exactly what it needs to do and hits more of 
            the requirements and it works as a one page website just would add more pages to separate them
            next time</p> 
        
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Benifits And Drawbacks Of The IT Tools And Systems Used</h1>

            <p> The Good thing about the IT tools I have used Trello helped me time and reminded me for the tasks
                needed for this website. I have looked at it and updated it when i completed the tasks. All the 
                other tools i used for this has provided me with completing this task and getting it up and running.
                I could do it in a team but i have gained a lot from solving the problems with the website.
    
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Improvments For Productivity And Efficiency</h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Team Work</h2>
            <P>The way i could improve on productivity and efficiency by working in a team and setting each of the
               different jobs and manage and help in each area. organise trello with the team to see who is doing
               and provide people working together on different areas if needed to know things and if they need 
               help in that area

            </P>

            <h2>Working On My Own</h2>
            <P> If i would work on my own again i would research how to make the content look better before starting
                the trying to edit the style. Also I would set my Trello as first thing to do then get my website 
                sorted out. I used slack for the idea of a website and the tasks for the website and to communicate
                with people if i am working in a team for other tasks.

            </P>
            
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Testing My Website</h1>

            <p> How i would test my website is by putting it on google chrome and test it on there and up it online 
                for other people to test the website and see if the images show up and the background along with 
                the pages. If there is problem with the website you know where about it is and then you can research
                code to use and to make it work. If there is word that are wrong just retype it where the error is.
            
            </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Content And Layout Of Page One</h1>

                    open them. Buy the hideously expensive » Microsoft Word, or just hope that it came with your computer.
